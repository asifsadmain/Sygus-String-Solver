# The following is the Context Free Grammar (CFG) for the Karel domain:

# ```
# Program œÅ := DEF run m( s m)
# Repetition n := Number of repetitions
# Perception h := frontIsClear | leftIsClear | rightIsClear | markerPresent | noMarkerPresent
# Condition b := perception h | not perception h
# Action a := move | turnLeft | turnRight | putMarker | pickMarker
# Statements := while c( b c) w( s w) | s1;s2 | a | repeat R=n r( s r) | if c( b c) i( s i) |
# ifelse c( b c) i(s1 i) else e( s2 e)
# ```

# Now, I have an 6x6 grid where the bot needs to pick a marker from a stair. The marker is at the top of the stairs. \
# If the row and column indices are from 0 to 5 and the bottomleft cell is (0,0), then the stairs create block at \
# (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3),(2,4), (3,4), (3,5) and (4,5). The marker is placed at (5,5). This problem is called "StairClimber".

# Your task is to write a program following the above CFG that can complete the "StairClimber" task.

found = False
last_program = None
latest_io_log = None
error_message = None

    finally:
        last_program = program

    count += 1

When the code throws exception, the "last_program" becomes "None". But I want to have the last_program assigned as program even when the exception is thrown.
